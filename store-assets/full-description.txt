ODU Yoruba Writer is a professional diacritic keyboard and language tool for writers, students, researchers, and anyone who wants to write fully-marked Yoruba text on their device.

★ DIACRITIC KEYBOARD
Type correctly toned Yoruba without switching keyboards. A dedicated Diacritic Mode lets you insert tone marks and open vowels (à, á, â, ẹ, ọ, ṣ, è, é, ê and more) with a single tap — no copy-pasting from charts.

★ TRANSLATION CHALLENGES
Practice Yoruba by completing real translation tasks contributed by the community. Fill-the-gap and full-sentence modes help reinforce vocabulary, tone memory, and grammar.

★ GLOBAL LEADERBOARD
See how your contributions compare with language enthusiasts from around the world. Rankings update from a live community dataset shared with researchers.

★ CONTRIBUTOR MAP
Explore a world map showing where ODU contributors are located — from Lagos to London, Atlanta to Berlin. Discover Yoruba language communities wherever they live.

★ LANGUAGE PRESERVATION
Every sentence you contribute becomes part of an open Yoruba language dataset, supporting AI research and helping ensure Yoruba is well-represented in digital and natural-language systems.

★ PRIVACY-FIRST
No ads. No third-party tracking. Internet is used only for leaderboard sync and optional account creation — the keyboard works fully offline. Your data is never sold.

★ FREE & OPEN SOURCE
ODU is free to download and use. The source code is open (MIT licence) on GitHub.
