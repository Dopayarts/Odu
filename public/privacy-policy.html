  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">
    <strong>ODU Yoruba Writer</strong> &nbsp;|&nbsp;
    Effective date: 24 February 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp;
    App ID: <code>com.yoruba.odu</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    ODU Yoruba Writer ("<strong>the App</strong>") is developed and maintained by
    <strong>Peace Toba Olatunji (Dopay)</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains what
    information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Short version:</strong> The App collects only the information you voluntarily
    provide (email, username, location). It contains no ads, no third-party tracking
    beyond Firebase (Google), and does not access your camera, microphone, contacts,
    or GPS location.
  </div>

  <!-- 1 -->
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>Account information (optional)</strong> — If you create an account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address — used for login via Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li>Username — a display name you choose; shown on the leaderboard.</li>
    <li>Self-reported location — a city or country you type in; never obtained from GPS.</li>
    <li>Account creation timestamp.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Contributions you submit (optional)</strong> — If you submit Yoruba/English
  sentence pairs through the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The English and Yoruba text you enter.</li>
    <li>Your username and self-reported location (if provided).</li>
    <li>Submission timestamp and challenge category.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Contributions are stored locally on your device and may be synced to our systems to
  support language-training datasets. You can export or delete your local contributions
  at any time from within the App.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaderboard data</strong> — Usernames, contribution counts, and locations of
  top contributors are listed publicly in the leaderboard. This data is sourced from a
  Google Sheet that is publicly accessible.</p>

  <p><strong>Usage analytics (automatic)</strong> — Firebase Analytics may collect
  anonymous event data (e.g. screens viewed, session duration) to help us improve the
  App. No personally identifying information is linked to analytics events.</p>

  <!-- 2 -->
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate your account and keep your session secure.</li>
    <li>To display your username and location on the leaderboard and contributor map.</li>
    <li>To build and improve Yoruba language datasets for open research.</li>
    <li>To detect and address abuse or policy violations (admin moderation).</li>
    <li>To understand how the App is used so we can make it better.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use it for advertising.</p>

  <!-- 3 -->
  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses the following third-party services, each governed by its own privacy policy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Firebase (Google LLC)</strong> — Authentication, cloud database (Firestore),
      and analytics. Google may process data on servers in the United States and other
      countries. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy</a> and
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Google Sheets (Google LLC)</strong> — The leaderboard is read from a
      publicly accessible Google Sheet CSV. No user data is written to Google Sheets by
      the App.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> integrate any advertising networks, third-party
  analytics SDKs (beyond Firebase), social login providers, or payment processors.</p>

  <!-- 4 -->
  <h2>4. Permissions Requested</h2>
  <p>On Android, the App requests only one permission:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET</strong> — Required to connect to Firebase and fetch leaderboard data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> request access to your GPS location, camera,
  microphone, contacts, storage, or any other sensitive system resources.</p>

  <!-- 5 -->
  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account profiles and admin flags are stored in Firebase Firestore, hosted by Google.</li>
    <li>Contributions are cached locally in your device's browser storage (localStorage)
    until synced.</li>
    <li>Leaderboard data is cached locally to reduce network requests.</li>
    <li>All communication with Firebase uses HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit.</li>
    <li>We apply reasonable technical measures to protect stored data, but no system is
    completely secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- 6 -->
  <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete your account and all associated personal data at any time using our
    dedicated deletion page:
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="data-deletion.html" style="font-weight:700;">
      → Request account and data deletion
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon verified request, we will delete your account record from Firebase within
    30 days and send a confirmation. Locally cached data on your device is removed
    when you uninstall the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contribution text that has already been incorporated into published language datasets
    may be retained in anonymised form for research integrity.
  </p>

  <!-- 7 -->
  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is designed as an educational and cultural language tool suitable for general
    audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13
    years of age. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account, please contact
    us and we will promptly delete the account and associated data.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child has provided us
    with personal information without your consent, please contact us at the address below.
  </p>

  <!-- 8 -->
  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your country or region, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Correct inaccurate data.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your account and data — see <a href="data-deletion.html">Delete My Account</a>.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain processing activities.</li>
    <li>Data portability (export your contributions via the in-app CSV export).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at the address in Section 9.</p>
